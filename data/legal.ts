      { h: "How we work", p: [

      ] },

If the balance is not paid by its due date, we may treat the booking as cancelled by you and apply the cancellation charges below.",

Changing names on flight tickets or permits may not be possible.",

Because we commit money to suppliers on your behalf, cancellation charges apply, increasing as your departure date gets closer, up to the full cost of the journey. The charges that apply to your booking are set out in your quote and booking confirmation. We recommend insurance that covers cancellation from the moment you book.",

Rain can make steppe tracks and river crossings impassable, snow can close the Altai and northern routes early, domestic flights to the Gobi and the west are often retimed, and festival programmes such as Naadam and the Golden Eagle Festival are set locally and can change. Minor changes, such as a different vehicle, a revised route or a change of guide, are part of travelling well and do not give rise to compensation.",

In that case we will refund all money you have paid us, or offer you an alternative if you prefer. We are not responsible for costs you incur that are not part of your booking with us, such as flights or visas you have arranged yourself.",

We are happy to share general information, but requirements change and depend on your nationality, so please check official government sources and take advice from your doctor or a travel health clinic in good time. We are not liable if you are unable to travel, or incur costs, because you do not have the right documents.",

Where international conventions limit the compensation a transport or accommodation provider must pay, our liability is limited in the same way. Except for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or where the law does not allow it, our total liability to you is limited to the price of your journey. Nothing in these terms limits rights you have under the laws that protect consumers in your country of residence.",
